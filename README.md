# US President Guessing Game

## About

There have been 46 United States presidents (so far), and this program can guess from any of them in just a few questions!

This game is played in the console. Think of a president. You will see a prompt. Answer 'yes' or 'y' if the prompt about that president is correct, and answer 'no' or 'n' if the prompt is incorrect.

This may also test your knowledge of the presidents if you aren't too familiar with what they have done in the past!
